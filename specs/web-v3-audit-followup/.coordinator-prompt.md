# Coordinator Prompt: web-v3-audit-followup

## Goal
Address remaining gaps from the V3 design audit: fix the search-index 422 bug, capture persistent screenshot evidence, validate all 20 admin tabs, and verify interaction flows.

## Spec Path
`specs/web-v3-audit-followup/`

## Execution Mode
Sequential task execution with functional validation. NO mocks/tests.

## Context
This is a follow-up to `specs/web-v3-audit/` which completed 46/46 implementation tasks. The implementation is solid (tsc/eslint/build all clean) but has validation gaps:
1. A real bug: search-index.ts requests limit=500 but API schema caps at 100 → 422
2. Zero persistent screenshot evidence (Puppeteer captures were session-only)
3. Admin tabs not individually validated via screenshots
4. Interaction flows (sidebar collapse, mobile drawer, variation switching) not captured

## Key Constraint
- NO modifications to existing API endpoints (FR-6 from original spec)
- Fix only the client-side search-index.ts bug and capture evidence
- Dev server at localhost:3000, Puppeteer MCP for screenshots
